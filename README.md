# JavaScript-Calculator

https://jiwoos.github.io/JavaScript-Calculator/

      - The web page has two input fields and a radio button group for the operation, with the 4 basic math operations represented (add, subtract, multiply, divide).
      - JavaScript monitors all three fields and display the current result whenever the user changes any value in any field, without refreshing the page.
      - The calculator should be completely self-contained; i.e., does not make any requests to any other server-side or client-side scripts or web pages after the initial page load.
